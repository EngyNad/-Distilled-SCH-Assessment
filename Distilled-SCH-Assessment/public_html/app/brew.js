            "description": "When J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller arrived in Montana in 1987 to take up his position as Brewmaster for Bayern Brewing, he was given the task of creating a beer that would win the hearts and tastebuds of Montanans who wanted, according to popular demand, a beer that is a traditional German M\u00e4rzen beer with a distinctive hop flavor. After some consideration, J\u00fcrgen came up with Bayern Amber Lager. To reach this delicate middle ground, Bayern Amber is made with the same type and quantity of malted barley used in German M\u00e4rzenbiers (an amber, rich \"festbier\"), and then hopped in the manner of existing Czech-style pilseners. So go ahead, have a Bayern Amber and taste Bayern\u2019s legacy, which has become a bit of living Montana history.",

            "description": "Dancing Trout Ale is a German Wheat Ale, the filtered version of a true Bavarian Hefeweizen. In Bavaria this beer would be called a Kristall-Weizen (Crystal-Wheat) because of its clarity. Dancing Trout Ale is brewed with malted wheat, pale and carmel malt, and moderately hopped using the best quality hops from Germany. Unlike its British and American counterparts, Dancing Trout Ale is brewed in the Bavarian tradition: aged a minimum of 28 days, versus 7-10 days for the average ale. This means Dancing Trout Ale is mild with no bitter aftertaste! We dedicate this beer to helping preserve Montana\u2019s trout habitat, one beer at a time. \r\n\r\n To truly appreciate Dancing Trout Ale as a year-round member of Bayern Brewing\u2019s line of fine beers, an explanation is in order. This is especially because it is possible that you may already know this beer by one or two different names. \r\n\r\n Back in 1987, this beer was known as Bayern Light Wheat Ale \u2014 the filtered version of our original Hefeweizen. In 2002, Light Wheat Ale took on the personality many beer connoisseurs came to know as Trout Slayer Ale. The beer and the name grew in popularity, especially with our outdoor and angling audience. Bayern Brewing celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2007, making it the oldest brewery operating in Montana. At that time, in order to honor our time-tested brew, we decided to change the name and the label image to best reflect Bayern Brewing's environmental company philosophy. In our search for a more appropriate name we kept coming back to Dancing Trout and Montana native artist Monte Dolack created yet another evocative image that was used for the label. Whether as a fishing term or in various spiritual expressions of music and dance, Dancing Trout has become a symbol celebrating the lifestyle embraced by Montana and the values of Bayern Brewing.",

            "description": "Since we brew beer in the Bavarian tradition at Bayern (which means Bavaria in German) our list of beer styles would not be complete without our most recent addition: Face Plant Doppelweizen. This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern\u2019s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of  17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.\r\n The formulation for this delicate beer came from the Brauerei zum Schiff in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. Bayern Brewing\u2019s proprietor, J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, was one of the last of five brewers that brewed this special beer in 1979 before the brewery, which was founded in 1540, sadly closed its doors due to the owner\u2019s passing. \r\n In fall of 2007, when it became apparent that the crisis of extremely high raw material prices would continue, the Bayern team decided to test the market with a brew that uses a very large amount of energy and raw materials while being the most difficult, labor-intensive, demanding beer that anyone could create. We told our distributors that we would do two brews at 1000 gallons each to see whether the market could handle the premium price that we had to charge due to these factors. \r\n Our \"Super Brew\" lasted only a couple of months and then completely sold out. \r\n So Bayern Brewing continues to brew Face Plant while its popularity continues to grow. Thus Doppelweizen has been revived here in Missoula, Montana, USA. We hope you will enjoy a piece of living beer history and a specialty beer that is truly rare, even in the Northwest\u2019s highly diversified beer landscape.",

According to German criteria for a true pilsener, however, the vast majority of them would be unrecognizable as such. By this definition, a pilsener is a lager beer with a light golden color (5-8 color units by European Brewers' Convention standards), a specific gravity in the 11.5-12.5% Plato range, and a hops content of at least 28 EBUs (European Bitter Units). Most so-called domestic \"pilseners\" fall far short in these categories; Bayern Pilsener easily meets all three (6 color units, 12% Plato, 34 EBUs).\r\n\r\n What does all this technical jargon mean? It means you have purchased one of the very few authenic pilseners brewed in America. Reward yourself by enjoying this beer the way it was meant to be served: pour your cold Bayern Pilsener, in two or three slow steps, into the center of your glass (a fluted or \"tulip\" glass works best). The thick creamy head (the German term for this is \"crown\") and you have just created the mark of a classic Bavarian pilsener. It is functional, too - the crown holds finely distributed natural carbonation inside the glass and acts as a shelter for this beer's distintive, hoppy flavor.",

            "description": "There's nothing better than Bayern's unfiltered Hefeweizen. This Bavarian Hefeweizen (\"hefe\" means yeast and \"weizen\" refers to wheat), combines pure wheat flavor with Bayern's own strain of yeast. Bayern's Hefeweizen is hopped moderately with Hallertauer Perle from Germany, has an alcohol content of 5.4% Alcohol by Volume (13.1% Plato o.g.) and is made using malted wheat, pale and caramel malt. The hefeweizen beer style was invented in Bavaria and Bayern Brewing's version is one of the very few that is actually brewed as it is in Bavaria by a Bavarian Brewmaster. So if you are interested in this style of beer, try this one first and see how the other ones compare to the original. \r\n\r\n St. Wilbur Weizen is brewed using the recipe of the old Brauerei zum Schiff brewery in Kaufbeuren, Germany, which is located 60 miles southwest of Munich and was established in 1540. J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, the owner of Bayern Brewing, apprenticed in this brewery from 1978 to 1981 and brought this original recipe to Missoula in 1987. \r\n\r\n In 2002, J\u00fcrgen decided to rename Bayern's Hefeweizen \"St Wilbur Weizen\" after his beloved St. Bernard, Wilbur, who had been adopted from the Humane Society. Sympathetic with the issues of these large breed dogs, Bayern now donates a portion of sales of this beer style and all affiliated merchandise to the Saint Bernard Rescue Foundation. To learn more about this, please read this edition of our Brewsletter. Whenever you think about Wilbur, just remember this: HE MAY BE A SAINT, BUT HE'S NO ANGEL!",
