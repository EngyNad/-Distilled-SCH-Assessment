            "description": "When J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller arrived in Montana in 1987 to take up his position as Brewmaster for Bayern Brewing, he was given the task of creating a beer that would win the hearts and tastebuds of Montanans who wanted, according to popular demand, a beer that is a traditional German M\u00e4rzen beer with a distinctive hop flavor. After some consideration, J\u00fcrgen came up with Bayern Amber Lager. To reach this delicate middle ground, Bayern Amber is made with the same type and quantity of malted barley used in German M\u00e4rzenbiers (an amber, rich \"festbier\"), and then hopped in the manner of existing Czech-style pilseners. So go ahead, have a Bayern Amber and taste Bayern\u2019s legacy, which has become a bit of living Montana history.",

            "description": "Dancing Trout Ale is a German Wheat Ale, the filtered version of a true Bavarian Hefeweizen. In Bavaria this beer would be called a Kristall-Weizen (Crystal-Wheat) because of its clarity. Dancing Trout Ale is brewed with malted wheat, pale and carmel malt, and moderately hopped using the best quality hops from Germany. Unlike its British and American counterparts, Dancing Trout Ale is brewed in the Bavarian tradition: aged a minimum of 28 days, versus 7-10 days for the average ale. This means Dancing Trout Ale is mild with no bitter aftertaste! We dedicate this beer to helping preserve Montana\u2019s trout habitat, one beer at a time. \r\n\r\n To truly appreciate Dancing Trout Ale as a year-round member of Bayern Brewing\u2019s line of fine beers, an explanation is in order. This is especially because it is possible that you may already know this beer by one or two different names. \r\n\r\n Back in 1987, this beer was known as Bayern Light Wheat Ale \u2014 the filtered version of our original Hefeweizen. In 2002, Light Wheat Ale took on the personality many beer connoisseurs came to know as Trout Slayer Ale. The beer and the name grew in popularity, especially with our outdoor and angling audience. Bayern Brewing celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2007, making it the oldest brewery operating in Montana. At that time, in order to honor our time-tested brew, we decided to change the name and the label image to best reflect Bayern Brewing's environmental company philosophy. In our search for a more appropriate name we kept coming back to Dancing Trout and Montana native artist Monte Dolack created yet another evocative image that was used for the label. Whether as a fishing term or in various spiritual expressions of music and dance, Dancing Trout has become a symbol celebrating the lifestyle embraced by Montana and the values of Bayern Brewing.",

Dump Truck uses a yeast strain, specially formulated in Germany, to make this beer a rare experience - like the one J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, Master Brewer and President of Bayern Brewing, had on one of our company rafting trips. He learned (first hand) that a Dump Truck is when the raft flips, depositing all contents not tied down into the raging river.

            "description": "Since we brew beer in the Bavarian tradition at Bayern (which means Bavaria in German) our list of beer styles would not be complete without our most recent addition: Face Plant Doppelweizen. This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern\u2019s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of  17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.\r\n The formulation for this delicate beer came from the Brauerei zum Schiff in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. Bayern Brewing\u2019s proprietor, J\u00fcrgen Kn\u00f6ller, was one of the last of five brewers that brewed this special beer in 1979 before the brewery, which was founded in 1540, sadly closed its doors due to the owner\u2019s passing. \r\n In fall of 2007, when it became apparent that the crisis of extremely high raw material prices would continue, the Bayern team decided to test the market with a brew that uses a very large amount of energy and raw materials while being the most difficult, labor-intensive, demanding beer that anyone could create. We told our distributors that we would do two brews at 1000 gallons each to see whether the market could handle the premium price that we had to charge due to these factors. \r\n Our \"Super Brew\" lasted only a couple of months and then completely sold out. \r\n So Bayern Brewing continues to brew Face Plant while its popularity continues to grow. Thus Doppelweizen has been revived here in Missoula, Montana, USA. We hope you will enjoy a piece of living beer history and a specialty beer that is truly rare, even in the Northwest\u2019s highly diversified beer landscape.",
