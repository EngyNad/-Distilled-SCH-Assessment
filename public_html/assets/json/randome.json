That was the concept Bell\u2019s beer guru John Mallett aimed for and, true to John\u2019s vision, Maillard\u2019s Odyssey is exactly that. Its name honors the Maillard reaction\u2014the \u201cbrowning\u201d of sugars and amino acids\u2014that creates the wonderful caramelized toffee-like and roasted flavors so abundant in this beer.\r\n\r\nBell\u2019s has done a lot to raise the Midwest\u2019s craft beer bona fides. They are masters of many beer styles from their portfolio of top-notch American stouts all the way through to the alpha acid assault of their Hopslam Ale.

They are unique beers unto themselves. Notes of banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and\/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with such yeast. Hop aroma, flavor and bitterness not usually found in the base style, can be medium to very high and must show the characters of American hop varieties. Dark color falls in the deep amber\/brown to black range. Roasted malts or barley may have a range of character from subtle to robust, and should be reflected in the overall character and balance of the beer. Esters should be at medium to high levels. Diacetyl should not be evident. Chill haze may be evident. Sulfurlike yeast character should be absent. No Brettanomyces character should be present. An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\"A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions. Beers with Brettanomyces may be subcategorized under this category","srmMin":"16","srmMax":"16","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:14"}},"status":"success"}
